### Missing Due to Time Limitation

- Facility to add funds feature
- Improved unit tests
- Bonus points features
- CI/CD options e.g. Terraform
- Downloadable app

### Footnotes

The app was developed and tested on a Mac, using iPhone simulator. Did not test with Android however it should work.

I spent a bit too long on the "technical foundation" because I did not have a Redux/TypeScript app template already set up. However I am happy with this.

In total I estimate that I spent 8 hours on what you see. 1 hour of that being a scrambled-together UI.

If I was to spend another 2-3 hours I believe that I could facilitate all tasks including the bonus points.
